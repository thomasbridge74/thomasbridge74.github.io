title: Another Attempt

I played with Jekyll at the tail end of 2015.   However, it now looks like I've forgotten all the useful
information.

So trying this again.    As a reminder to myself, the process for adding a blog entry
is as follows:

Create the file in the _posts folder in the main folder of my username.github.ie repository.

		git add <filename>
		git commit -m "<Comment>"
		git push
  
And... that's it.

The photo below is a test of placing images into a Markdown Document.   It's a screen shot taken by Stephen Shirley of an IRC chat 
in 2003 when I was logged on to the [ILUG's](http://www.linux.ie) IRC server from a cybercafe in Krakow, Poland.
