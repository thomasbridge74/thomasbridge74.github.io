I played with Jekyll at the tail end of 2015.   However, it now looks like I've forgotten all the useful
information.

So trying this again.    AS a reminder to myself, the process for adding a blog entry
is as follows:

Create the file in the _posts folder in the main folder of my username.github.ie repository.

  git add <filename>
  git commit -m "<Comment>"
  git push
  
And... that's it.
