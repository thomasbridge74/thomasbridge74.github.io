title: First post in Jekyll
---

So I've been trying to install Jekyll on my Macbook running Mac OS X Yosemite.    (The reason I've not upgraded is that 
 my version of
Parallels, which I use for Windows stuff, insists it won't run under El Capitan.

I've spent two days exploring issues getting the jekyll commands to install - I did have the Mac Developer tools,
and I couldn't work it out.    Until I realised I had a really old version of XCode installed on the machine - it claimed
to be 4.x.y from memory.    A quick trip to the App Store, install the latest version of XCode (over the old version)
and bingo it worked.
